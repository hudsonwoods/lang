<p>
	 Minis Shabu Shabu restaurant is a 4,200 square foot space on three levels that was renovated after being in operation for ten years. A fresh and durable palette of materials within a newly configured and more efficient space, seats 124, including 16 bar seats.
</p>
<p>
	 The former spaces were disjointed due to shifting levels and large structural elements. A new undulating ceiling of rope held by painted steel armatures knits the spaces together. The tables were custom fabricated with walnut and painted steel. Salvaged walnut was used in the construction of walls, soffits and screens. Dark grey stone lines the entry and services areas.
</p>
<p>
	 The design process was significantly defined by an active working relationship with the client, who is a contractor by trade. Details were often sketched together with the client, allowing for very precise and practical solutions. Dialog flowed smoothly and occurred often, creating a process that made for quick decisions and rewarding results.
