The Faubourg St. Roch Project (FSRP) is a 501(c)(3) non-profi t organization founded by Drew Lang following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 as a holistic and community based effort toward revitalizing one of New Orleans’ most historic neighborhoods, Faubourg St. Roch. Endowed with inherent urban density and richness, layered with extraordinary historic architecture, and proximate to the city center, we strongly believe the St. Roch neighborhood is poised for renewal. In spite of blight and decay caused by decades of neglect, and further setbacks caused by Katrina. St. Roch is a place that will flourish with focused efforts, combined with the efforts of partners and widespread community participation.

The St. Roch Art Walk on the oak-lined median of St. Roch Avenue, extending 6 blocks from the historic St. Roch Market to a local park, is in the process of being renovation and will be complete in the Fall of 2013. The FSRP team has envisioned the Art Walk as both a large-scale civic art project and a way to focus and build neighborhood pride. Landscaped greenery will be used to enhance a mosaic path and the magnificent old oaks.

In the Fall of 2007 an open competition was held, inviting national and local artists to participate in the collaborative design of a 12 foot wide and 6 block long mosaic walk – a ribbon of color down the center of St. Roch neutral ground. A jury selected artist was hired to work together with the community to transform ideas about the local history, culture and spirit into art. The Art Walk is now in the process of becoming a tapestry of the lives of the neighborhood. The ideas of residents are being woven into an inspiring and harmonious design in a way that creates an outdoor living room for the community.

The St. Roch Art Walk is a way to enhance the everyday lives of this resilient community and to contribute to the shaping and rebuilding of New Orleans culture. A nationally recognized civic artwork has the potential to attract locals and tourists to participate in the neighborhood culture and economy, and make a place for art in the daily lives of a community in need.
