The Linden Hotel is a 16,000 square foot building with 38 guest rooms, designed in a manner that maximizes allowable built area on a small site.  The design is further informed by a client seeking to create a unique and memorable sensory experience for guests.

An atrium scheme opens the compact building to light and views through the building to spaces and activity beyond.  The lobby straddles the public and private realms, and has both an inviting and secure sensibility.  Stairs and bridges delicately traverse the open space of the atrium, providing access to guest rooms and the open breakfast area below.

An interlocking polycarbonate system combined with expanded metal mesh form a building skin which is intermittently transparent, translucent and opaque. A strategic grid forms the composition allowing light and views through an interstitial space between cellar and second floor guest rooms, carves niches to promote or conceal building elements, and otherwise crafts moments of surprise.
