<p>
	The Parc Hotel is a 49,000 square foot building with 96 guest rooms located in downtown Flushing and La Guardia airport. The building is 12 stories high with staggered setbacks at the upper level and clad in Spanish limestone. The floor to ceiling panels and windows are playfully arranged in a rhythmic pattern across the fa√ßade. The flamed, bush-hammered and sawn finish of the panels creates a variety of textures.

<p>
	The hotel program includes restaurant, a business center, rooftop lounge with panoramic views of Manhattan and a fitness center. The bespoke wood furniture in the rooms lends warmth to the modern interiors.
